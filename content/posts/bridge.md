When people ask me about my hobby, I always have a dilemma. Do I tell them about bridge, and get the classic "isn't that an old person game?" response or answer something more normal like bridge? However, I can't blame them because most kids are unaware of what bridge truly is. I used to be in their shoes and not know what bridge was. Thinking back to elementary school, before I got into bridge and invested the next 6 years of my life into this card game, I never would have guessed that my bridge career would have turned out how it did. 

During the summer of 4th grade, my parents signed my brother, who is two years older than me, and I up for a week-long camp at our local Ocee library for something called bridge. At that time, I had no idea what bridge was. I don't think anyone who attended the camp knew. One of my closest bridge friends thought bridge literally meant building a bridge using cards. At this camp, I learned that bridge was a complex card game that involved both bidding and card play. It requires 4 people, or 2 pairs. After this weeklong 10 hour camp I was hooked. After a casual first year of weekly classes on Mondays at Ocee library under Ms. Karen, who hosted the camp, Ms. Karen recommended me to Ms. Eckert. Ms. Eckert taught advanced kids, while Ms. Karen specialized with beginners. 

The last student that Ms. Eckert took under her wing, I was introduced to a group of students from the Alpharetta area who are mostly my brother's age. For the next 5 years, Ms. Eckert taught this group of kids every Friday for 2 hours at her house, and we practiced on Sunday's under the USBF Junior Training Program. Aside from all this practice, we needed real experience, so we constantly played in games. Due to school, we typically only played once a month, playing whenever we had a school day off. The two clubs that we played the most at were in Alpharetta and Roswell, due to their rather close distance. Each game lasted around 3 hours, and costs kids around $7 and adults $15. It was at these games that I was able to see the local bridge scene, as outside of those clubs, and my fellow students, no one played the game, or even really knew what it was. Matches at these local clubs were mostly against adults, as the junior scene in Atlanta was below par. However, the first few years I played there were junior games a few times a year. Two of my best games ever were at juniors games where my pair got a score of 70%, which is outstanding considering anything over 60% is really good. 

As our desire to compete grew, we decided to travel further to play. Over longer breaks, we drove further to participate in larger events, such as regionals and sectionals. For example, we played at Crown Plaza, Conyers, Gainesville, and even spent a week in Charleston!  At Crown Plaza I arguably had my best game ever in a team of 4 with my Alpharetta friends, placing first out of 45 teams. Charleston was my favorite bridge experience, as 8 of my bridge friends travelled to Charleston in South Carolina for a whole week with the sole purpose of playing bridge, with two adults. The whole week was dedicated to playing bridge, as even if we wanted to we were unable to go travel as we couldn't drive. Each day we had the same schedule: wake up, play bridge, eat, play bridge, eat, sleep. We played a minimum of two games, and three if we woke up early enough. I played and performed well enough to win the most masterpoints out of anyone in my category. 

Outside of places within driving distance, I also competed at the Youth NABC for five years, from 2012-2016. These nationals were held across the country, and I travelled to Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Washington DC, and Chicago to compete at them, and one was held here in Atlanta. It was at these Junior NABC's that I finally was able to meet the youth scene in bridge, and arguably what kept me coming back to bridge, as I made lots of friends through these events. On average around 300 kids show up for a three day event, which includes one warmup day, a pairs championship and a team championship. I never did well in the pairs championship, with my highest placing coming 9th in 2016. However, team wise, my team of six managed to place 3rd in 2015, my proudest achievement. Outside of results, Youth NABC was always a great experience to meet some of the best bridge players in the country, and even foreign players. I've made countless friends through Youth NABC, and it is a real shame that 2016 was the last year that I competed, as my Alpharetta group have now moved on in life and no longer play, and are too old anyways. While I love all of them and will always remember them, two stand out, Alec and Caleb. These two were my favorite partners. I first played with Alec for a year before switching over the Caleb and playing with him for over three years. In bridge, the pairs must have good chemistry and be able to communicate effectively, and I found a connection with Caleb that I have yet and most likely will never find again. 

The biggest competition I have competed in was the USBF Jr Trials. This is the competition that decides the USA Junior Team for the World Championships. A biennial competition, I entered with absolutely no confidence that I would win, as I knew that the best players in the nation would be competing, and I was only there for the experience. Sadly, I did very poorly both times that I have competed in 2015 and 2017, getting 7th both years, which was second to last and last. These two tournaments really proved to me that I was not putting enough effort into bridge, and were key to me deciding to stop playing bridge after 2017. 

After 2017, I had planned on putting a hiatus on bridge, as my group had all entered college and slowly stopped playing the game as we lost touch, and I played with a team that I had found online and never played with or met with face to face, as my partner was from California and teammates from New Jersey. By coincidence, in 2013, the world championships were held in Atlanta, and the USA for some unknown reason decided to allow anyone who was a US citizen to enter. Obviously, I entered playing for fun as it was during the summer, and as expected I was creamed and placed near the bottom of the rankings. 

There are a few boards and matches that I will never forget. Once at Crown Plaza, our team blitzed the first three rounds, which means that we obtained the maximum number of points possible in those rounds, which being able to do in one round is already an achievement. Another board was at World's in 2013. Playing one of the best pairs in the nation, we lucked out on a miscommunication and they ended up making a disastrous accident, which allowed Caleb and I to luck out and be top 10 in the world for just a few minutes. Miscommunications happen all the time to everyone including myself, and one that I will never forget was at a midnight knockout match with a friend who I've never played with before. Due to a lack of experience, our bidding went astray quickly as I thought he promised spades when he reality he only had spades. This ended up negating insanely good play from our teammates as we got doubled and went down around 5.  

Ms. Eckert sacrificed her hard work and time for our group of kids free of charge. She drove us to all the games, taught us everything we know, and was a constant light in my life. The greatest gift in my life, Ms. Eckert was responsible for the best 5 years of my life. Always positive, she was always there for my bridge group throughout our journey, through the ups and downs. In 2016, when I was a high school freshman, Ms. Eckert suffered a stroke, and was forced to stop playing and teaching bridge. She soon moved an hour away to be near her kids, and I was never able to see her again. Towards the end of 2018, I was notified out of the blue of her death by my brother. This news shocked me, and I have never truly gotten over it, and I still think of her all the time, missing her positive personality, and never haven gotten the opportunity to fully show my appreciation to her. She was there for my team after we were destroyed in trials for the United States Junior Bridge team, and she was there when we placed third place at youth nationals in Chicago. She even went out of her way to write a little card to all of my team after the 2015 trials after she saw how down and depressed we were. I was only able to achieve everything I have in bridge thanks to her seeing potential in me and taking me in. Ms. Eckert was and will always be an inspiration to me and I strive to be like her in the future. Despite having stopped playing bridge, it is merely a hiatus and I promise myself that I will not quit and that I will get back into this hobby of mine, no matter how old I will be then. I have made some of my favorite memories ever playing bridge with kids and adults alike, and I would not replace these memories with anything else. If you ever read this, Alec and Caleb, thank you for everything that you have done for me. To the others who know who they are, thank you as well. 


Throughout 2018 I mentioned to my friends about hosting a bridge camp, but no concrete progress was made, and after Ms. Eckert's death late in 2018, I felt even more compelled to host this camp as a way to show respect to her. After positive encouragement from my closest friends, I reached out to Ms. Tucker, a longtime bridge teacher who heads the Atlanta Junior Bridge program. After describing my story to her, I mentioned interest in hosting a camp, and she was quickly eager to help me put this idea into reality. We initially met at Ocee library, but when we inquired about hosting this camp, we were unfortunately told that the library was being closed for renovation over the summer. Refusing to let this stop my plans, I reached out to countless other libraries and public places, such as churches. After about 5 rejections, the manager of then Gwinnett County Public Library Suwanee branch showed interest and after a long discussion, he offered me a spot during the week of July 22 to 26.
