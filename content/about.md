Welcome! 

I am Vincent Zhu, a senior at Northview High School in the Atlanta Area.

Currently, I participate in many clubs:

Programming Club, where I am co-President,

FBLA, which I have attended all 3 NLC conferences so far, placing 6th as a freshman, and 1st as a sophmore, and a finalist as a junior.

and NCHS, where I volunteer time to future Chinese culture in the community.  

I also enjoy playing tennis and bridge among other activities during my free time.
