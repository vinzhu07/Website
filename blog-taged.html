                After getting rejected from Tag-Ed's summer internship program, I was clicking around the tag ed website
                when I noticed
                a program called Tomorrow's Technologists Coding Camp. With my summer empty at that time, I decided to
                apply. With no
                interview process, there seemed to be no loss. Soon after I forgot about it. After been rejected yet
                again from Cisco's
                high school program, this became my only major option over the summer. Miraculously, I ended up getting
                accepted into
                the program, a four week summer program, which lasts from June 17th to July 19th, with the first week of
                July off for
                July 4th. This seemed to fit my plans well, as I had FBLA the last weekend of June, and could use both
                of my absences
                then.
              </p>
              <p>
                After orientation was pushed back a week, I became slightly skeptical about this camp, as no one I knew
                applied for this
                camp. At the orientation, I noticed the general demographic of the attendees, out of the 27 kids
                present, two including
                myself were Asian, and the vast majority, around 20 kids, were Indian. After not recognizing anyone, I
                honestly did not
                enter the camp with very high expectations. The camp was structured in a way that each week had four
                days at the Georgia
                Tech campus and 1 at the LexisNexis Risk Solutions headquarters in Alpharetta. The camp at GT was held
                in a classroom on
                the third floor of the College of Computing building.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first week, which was considered fundamentals, was spent in scratch, which is block based
                programming. Honestly, I
                didn't enjoy the first week. Scratch was boring and very limited, and I didn't have many friends, as a
                good portion of
                the kids already knew each other from being from the same school. That Friday at LexisNexis Risk
                Solutions, many of
                their department VP's came to talk to us, which I enjoyed, but there was no real interaction. The second
                week was spent
                on python. This week was an improvement as I personally enjoy coding most projects I do in python.
                However, I took both
                days of absence the Thursday and Friday of that week as I had to be in San Antonio for FBLA. Turns out
                that Thursday
                they had two different guest speakers, what a great day to miss! After that, the following week was a
                break week as it
                was the first week in July. I didn't really think about the camp as I was in Texas for a good portion of
                the week and
                catching up on sleep the rest of the week. Web development was the focus of week three, and I got my
                first insight into
                HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. In the three days that were spent learning web dev, multiple different
                speakers came in. Most
                of the speakers who spoke to us at Georgia Tech were either college students or young adults in the
                field.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ultimate end goal of the program was for students to create a product that they were interested in
                and thought could
                solve a problem. Kids who had ideas already gave pitches. Some of the pitches included a scripting
                language for kids and
                a volunteer app among others. When asked to choose the one I wanted to be in a group with, I chose a kid
                whose pitch was
                a carpool app. However, I didn't want to to work with him because I was into the idea, I felt he was the
                best team
                leader up there, and I was not disappointed with my pick. We ended up creating a virtual assistant
                called Trippy. Our
                project, Trippy Maps, consisted of a chatbot and an itinerary. What this chatbot does in a nutshell is
                take in user
                input, parse it, and search keywords or the whole string into Google Maps API. Three APIs are called in
                total: Place
                searches a string of words into Google Maps and uses IP bias to get search results closer to the user
                and returns a name
                and place id if a result is found; Place Details returns a list of details about a specific location
                when given the
                place id, which is unique for every place; The final one, called Distance Matrix, used place ids to find
                the distance
                and time needed to travel between two locations. We decided to do our chatbot in Python and code our
                website in Django,
                but with very little prior experience, we were unable to have Trippy's output show up on the website, so
                we hardcoded an
                example of what the chat would look like and ran Trippy in the terminal. At that point, we knew we had
                very little
                chance of winning the best product award, and decided to focus on the best presentation award. We used a
                template for
                our website which we thought was aesthetic and decided to do a live demo of our bot which we knew
                worked. During the
                presentation, we asked the judges for live input, and we planned them an itinerary which took them to a
                gas station at
                Sam's Mart and a bar at Natsu Sushi Bar & Ocean Grill. The judges enjoyed our presentation enough to
                present us with the best presentation award.

              <p> If you would like a look at the code I have it hosted <a href="https://repl.it/@vinzhu07/Chatbot">here
                  on Repl.it</a>. Note that it doesn't run because I removed the API key for safety and security
                reasons.</p>
              <p>
                What an experience this was; made many new connections and friendships that I will cherish forever!
